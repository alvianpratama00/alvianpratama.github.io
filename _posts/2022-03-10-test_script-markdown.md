Heart disease is the cause major cause of death in many countries. This researchaims to detect "Heart Disease"
by using the algorithm used in data mining. This scientific work offers how to detect the disease with
using the decision tree method in the form of C5.0 algorithm. 

In this study the variablebound used is the target that
denoted by “0” and “1”. “0” meansno heart disease and “1” means
there is heart disease, the data are categorical. independent variables such as heart rate,
blood pressure, cholesterol level in the blood the data is numeric. 

From this research resulting in an accuracy of 6% which is
a fairly low level of accuracy. The accuracy small because it uses a variable
categorical with different levels which tend to follow that level so accuracy
also becomes small.
